### TUNSA AI

**Technologies:** Python, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib Pyplot, Seaborn, scikit-learn, K-means clustering

## Introduction

This project delves into the realm of predictive analytics with a focus on term deposit subscriptions. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques including logistic regression and K-means clustering, it aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies by streamlining customer segmentation and subscription prediction, thus enhancing marketing campaign effectiveness.

## Project Scope

The project spanned from February 19, 2022, to February 20, 2022. It was undertaken by 3-members of the Tunisian Space Association (TUNSA)'s AI team. It involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development phases. 

## Technical Details

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Elimination of 9 irrelevant features, reducing dataset dimensionality by 55%, enhancing model efficiency without compromising performance.
- **Feature Correlation Analysis**: Leveraging of Seaborn's heatmaps to identify and remove correlated features, reducing dimensionality by 36% and minimizing overfitting risk.
- **Data Transformation**: Utilization of LabelEncoder and LabelBinarizer to convert categorical variables into numerical formats, streamlining data representation for compatibility with machine learning models.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Employment of K-means clustering to categorize customers based on characteristics, identifying a segment with a 28% subscription rate, which facilitated targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Subscription Prediction**: Implementation of logistic regression to predict term deposit subscriptions, achieving 88.9% training accuracy and 88.06% test accuracy, providing a robust binary classification model for marketing optimization.
